This edited photo shows a set of traffic lights that I snapped in Vienna, Austria. I waited for the lights to change so I could merge both the ‘stop’ and ‘go’ lights into a single image.

I’m a sucker for these kinds of things. They might appear entirely performative to most people, but they really resonate with me as an LGBT+ person. Even if it’s only a little thing, it shows someone cared enough to do _something_ to make life a bit easier for people like me.
