I made this “NES Frame” as a gift for my dad for Christmas.

The piece is made of a replica Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) cartridge and embedded display, powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero W. The display shows a looped video – roughly 10 minutes long – of video games my dad enjoys, like Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, DOOM, and Tetris. 

Whilst, strictly speaking, not all of those games were released for the NES, I wanted to make it something uniquely his.
