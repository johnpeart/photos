This was an installation at the TATE Modern by the artist Olafur Eliasson. It was my favourite part of the exhibition.

It was a giant, spiky metal object, laden with coloured glass. A large, bright light in the centre of it shone through the glass and cast dozens of interlocking, vibrant shapes all over the wall.

As I was looking at it, I felt like lots of people were really staring at this giant, spiky orb hanging from the ceiling, but I was much more interested in the technicolour light show on the walls.
