One of my favourite things to photograph are fireworks. They are fleetingly difficult to capture, and I’ve spent years trying to get better at taking photographs of them. 

Shutter speeds set to maximum, I take hundreds – sometimes thousands – of photos during a display, in the hopes that some of them come out _just right_.
