It’s odd that it’s taken a pandemic for me to appreciate my local park. I’ve always enjoyed running round Finsbury Park, but I’ve never really stopped to take it in.

It turns out that it’s a treasure trove of wildlife; I’d just never noticed.

This is one of two swans that have appeared in the park in recent days, alongside some freshly hatched signets. This one was cleaning itself next to the pond, so I thought I’d take an impromptu snap.

Nature is healing.
