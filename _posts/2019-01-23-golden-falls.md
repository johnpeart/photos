The Golden Falls are one of many sights to see on the Icelandic Golden Circle. Despite the name, they are not golden, but they are certainly awe inspiring.

Mind you, you wonâ€™t want to stay for long in the winter months. It was -10 degrees Celsius when we arrived, and we lasted all of 5 minutes before dashing back inside for a hot chocolate to warm back up.
