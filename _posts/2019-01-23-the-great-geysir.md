This is the Great Geysir in Iceland. It spontaneously erupts in huge clouds of steam several times an hour. Especially in the sub-zero temperatures of that day, the steam creates these huge plumes, dozens of metres high.

Apparently the eruptions are getting smaller over time. You wouldnâ€™t know it from this picture, with the distant and tiny people in the background.
