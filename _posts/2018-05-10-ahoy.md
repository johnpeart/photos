If you know me, you know I’m a _huge_ Eurovision fan. I’m one of those peculiar people who legitimately claim it as a hobby.

The 2018 Contest was hosted by Portugal, and I had the thrill of attending the show in person for the second time. I’ve got to be honest, the organisation surrounding the event was not good. I’d go as far as to say it was actually very bad, but nonetheless the show itself was great.

The inside of a stadium isn’t the greatest place to take photographs when you’re not allowed to take in a full-size camera, but this panorama – taken just before the start of the first televised semi-final – shows off the stadium in it’s entirety.
