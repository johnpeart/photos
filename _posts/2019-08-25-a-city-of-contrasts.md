When you think about it, London is a very bizarre city; full of contradictions. 

As I stood taking in the botanical gardens at Kew in South London, overhead, without fail, every 30 seconds would be a large plane coming into land.

This photo captured the contradictions of the city in a moment; at once incredibly serene but continually juxtaposed against the hustle and bustle of modern life.
