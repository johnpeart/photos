This photo was taken on my first ever trip to Kew Gardens. It’s a close-up shot of a a beautiful pink flower that I took in the Temperate House. 

It’s colours were really striking, so I wanted to get as close to it as I could before my iPhone was unable to keep focus. This was the resulting photo.
