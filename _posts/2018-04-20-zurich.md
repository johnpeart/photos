Sometimes you visit a place and you think “Wow. Wouldn’t it be nice to live here? Imagine waking up to that view!” Then you realise how much it costs just to buy a cup of coffee and you check your priorities.

That’s Zurich.

Amazingly, jaw-droppingly beautiful. Amazingly, jaw-droppingly expensive.

But _just look at that view_!
